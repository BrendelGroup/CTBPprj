# 1. Aligning the reads to the mm39 mouse genome:
#
rws ./xbt2VSmm39 >& log



# Checking on the alignment results:
#
rws ./xPEmapping_success
rws ./xSEmapping_success

#
# ... produces *.mapped.read.counts, mapping_success.summary (which should
#  show 100% for all samples because the *.bam files should include only
#  properly mapped read pairs at this point), and read_processing.summary
#  (which gives a table of surviving read numbers from the original downloads
#  through the stages of trimming, dusting, and mapping; percentages are
#  calculated relative to the original download sets).
