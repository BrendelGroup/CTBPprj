# The run1 ChIPseq data consists of 2 CTBP samples (chsCTBP[1-2]) and
# 1 control sample (chsCTRL1).

# After quality control (as per Makefile_PR-template), between 96.04% and
# 96.67% read pairs from the original data survive as "clean" reads, and
# between 10.6K and 18.7K reads per sample are removed ("tagdusted") as
# matching Ms_rRNA.

# FASTQ reports before and after cleaning can be viewed with
#	firefox */*/*html

# "table" gives summary statistics for the clean read sets. The samples have
# between 26.5M and 32.7M read pairs, with corresponding total sequence size 
# 1.65Gb and 2.04Gb, respectively.
