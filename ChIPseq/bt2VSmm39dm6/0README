# Read mapping to the combined mm39 plus dm6 genome, using bowtie2. To reproduce the
#  results, you can simply execute the following command:
#
time bash ./0Record

#
#  real	321m57.360s
#user	3664m34.580s
#sys	53m24.918s

# See xmapPEbt2 for details.
# The final output are sorted *.bam files (with *.bai index) with only properly
#  aligned read pairs (SAM codes 99/147 or 83/163), separated to each genome.
