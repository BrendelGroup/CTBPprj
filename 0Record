# 1. Genome data were obtained from NCBI Genome and put into directory "genome":
#
mkdir genome
cd genome
ln -s GCF_000001635.27_GRCm39_genomic.fna Mmus.gdna.fa
ln -s GCF_000001635.27_GRCm39_genomic.gff Mmus.gff

# The following rRNA gene accessions were pulled from NCBI Nucleotide into file
# "Ms_rRNA" (used for screeing out rRNA tags in the RNAseq data):
#
# V00849.1 Mouse gene for 45S ribosomal RNA
# X00525.1 Mouse 28S ribosomal RNA
# X00686.1 Mouse gene for 18S rRNA
# J01871.1 Mouse 5.8S ribosomal RNA
# K02235.1 Mouse 5S rRNA gene M4

# Note: Gene Ctbp1 is on chromosome 5 (NC_000071.7:33405067-33432467) and
#       gene Ctbp2 is on chromosome 7 (NC_000073.7:132588727-132725908)

# 2. We create a tools directory to store software we need:
#
mkdir tools
cd tools
# vi 0README # ... record instructions executed by the next step:
#
bash 0README 
cd ..


# 3. The downloads directory contains the experimental sequence data downloaded
#    from CGB:
#
cd downloads/run1
./xln
cd ../..


# 4. RNASEQ analysis:
#
cd RNASEQ
cd reads
cd ..
