# The run1 RNAseq data consists of 3 knockdown samples (CTBPknd[1-3]) and
# 3 control samples (CTBPctrl[1-3]).

# A preliminary run of the workflow identified the sequences collected in
# artifacts.fa as over-represented sequences (FastQC report). The modified
# Makefile template uses tagdust to remove all matching reads.

# After quality control (as per Makefile_PR-template), between 96.82% and
# 97.78% read pairs from the original data survive as "clean" reads, and
# between 253K and 708K reads per sample are removed ("tagdusted") as
# matching artifactsi (rRNA or artifacts.fa sequences).

# FASTQ reports before and after cleaning can be viewed with
#	firefox */*/*html

# "summary.stats" gives summary statistics for the clean read sets. The samples
# have between 25.8M and 31.7M read pairs, with corresponding total sequence
# size about 2 * 1.61Gb and 2 * 1.98Gb, respectively.
