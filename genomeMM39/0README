# To download the genome data for mouse (version mm39), you can simply execute
#  the following command:
#
time bash ./0Record 

#real	29m19.926s
#user	68m7.440s
#sys	14m7.783s

# See comments in 0Record for details.

# We also need an mm39 blacklist, which we obtained from the following site:
#
# https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sF9m8Y3eZouTZ3IEEywjs2kfHOWFBSJT 
#  ... provides mm39.excluderanges.bed.gz
#
# Documentation:	https://github.com/dozmorovlab/excluderanges
#
#	mv ~/Downloads/mm39.excluderanges.bed.gz ./

# Exclude ranges starting with 0 cause the ChIPQC function ChIPQCsample() to throw
#  a fatal error:
#	Error: subscript contains out-of-bounds ranges
# We get around this by starting those ranges from 1000 instead:
#
#	gunzip mm39.excluderanges.bed.gz
#	sed -e "s/	0	/	1000	/" mm39.excluderanges.bed > mm39.blacklist.bed
